# Overview
A basic webapp that allows the user to fetch realtime stock data of a company and visualizes it with Mathplot. You can also download the data as a CSV file. I created this webapp as an exercise for using APIs and will extend it later on in my studies.
## Running the Project
In order to run the app just open the folder in an IDE of you choice and install the required packages:
``` py
pip install requirements.txt
python stock_tracker.py
```
## Feedback 
If you have any feedback or suggestions of improvement hit me up on one on my socials and we can collaborate.
