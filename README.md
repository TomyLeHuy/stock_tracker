# Overview
A basic webapp that allows the user to fetch realtime stock data of a company and visualizes it using Mathplot. The user can also download the stockdata as a CSV file. I created this project as an exercise in order to learn more about APIs and intend to extend the project later on in my studies.

## Running the project
In order to run the project you have to install the packages needed and run the pythonfile:
```py
pip install requirements.txt
python stock_tracker.py
```
